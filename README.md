## 🏦 Global Banking Market Capitalization — PySpark Data Analysis (Simulation)

### 📌 Overview
This project analyzes global banking market capitalization data using **PySpark**, simulating an ETL and cloud-style workflow. The dataset contains top global banks ranked by market value, with exchange rate data to convert USD values into GBP, EUR, and INR.

The goal is to practice Spark-based data processing, financial analytics, and local cloud-style storage behavior. Outputs are saved in CSV and Parquet formats inside a **simulated S3 folder** (local directory only — no real AWS usage).

### 📎 Data Source
Wikipedia — *List of largest banks by market capitalization*

> **Note:** In several steps, `.toPandas()` was used to convert Spark DataFrames to pandas DataFrames. This was done primarily to make the results easier to view and display clearly on GitHub and within the notebook environment. In real large-scale workloads, Spark display functions would be used instead to avoid unnecessary memory usage.
